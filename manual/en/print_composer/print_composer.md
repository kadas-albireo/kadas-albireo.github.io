# Print Composer <a name="print-composer"></a>

With the Print Composer you can create maps and atlasses that can be printed or saved as PDF-file, an image or an SVG-file. This is a powerfull way to share geographical information produced with KADAS that can be included in reports or published.

The Print Composer provides layout and printing capabilities. It allows you to add elements such as the map canvas, text labels, images, legends, scale bars, basic shapes, arrows, attribute tables and HTML frames. You can size, group, align, position and rotate each element and adjust the properties to create your layout. The layout can be printed or exported to image formats, PostScript, PDF or to SVG. You can save the layout as a template and load it again in another session. Finally, generating several maps based on a template can be done through the atlas generator. The following list gives an overview of the available tools which are available in menus and as icons in a toolbar:

## Overview of the Print Composer <a name="overview-of-the-print-composer"></a>

Opening the Print Composer provides you with a blank canvas that represents the paper surface when using the print option. With the buttons on the left beside the canvas you can add map composer items: the current map canvas, text labels, images, legends, scale bars, basic shapes, arrows, attribute tables and HTML frames. In this toolbar you also find toolbar buttons to navigate, zoom in on an area and pan the view on the composer and toolbar buttons to select a map composer item and to move the contents of the map item.

The initial view of the Print Composer before any elements are added is illustrated below:

![](/images/print_composer_blank.png)

On the right beside the canvas you find two panels. The upper panel holds the tabs *Items* and *Command History* and the lower panel holds the tabs *Composition*, *Item properties* and *Atlas generation*.

-   The *Items* tab provides a list of all map composer items added to the canvas.
-   The *Command history* tab displays a history of all changes applied to the Print Composer layout. With a mouse click, it is possible to undo and redo layout steps back and forth to a certain status.
-   The *Composition* tab allows you to set paper size, orientation, the page background, number of pages and print quality for the output file in dpi. Furthermore, you can also activate the <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Print as raster* checkbox. This means all items will be converted to raster before printing or saving as PostScript or PDF. In this tab, you can also customize settings for grid and smart guides.
-   The *Item Properties* tab displays the properties for the selected item. Click the <img src="/images/mActionSelect.png" /> <i>Select/Move item</i> icon to select an item (e.g., legend, scale bar or label) on the canvas. Then click the *Item Properties* tab and customize the settings for the selected item.
-   The *Atlas generation* tab allows you to enable the generation of an atlas for the current Composer and gives access to its parameters.
-   Finally, you can save your print composition with the <img src="/images/mActionFileSave.png" /> <i>Save Project</i> button.

In the bottom part of the Print Composer window, you can find a status bar with mouse position, current page number and a combo box to set the zoom level.

You can add multiple elements to the Composer. It is also possible to have more than one map view or legend or scale bar in the Print Composer canvas, on one or several pages. Each element has its own properties and, in the case of the map, its own extent. If you want to remove any elements from the Composer canvas you can do that with the `Delete` or the `Backspace` key.

### Navigation tools <a name="navigation-tools"></a>

To navigate in the canvas layout, the Print Composer provides some general tools:

- <img src="/images/mActionZoomIn.png" /> <i>Zoom in</i>
- <img src="/images/mActionZoomOut.png" /> <i>Zoom out</i>
- <img src="/images/mActionZoomFullExtent.png" /> <i>Zoom full</i>
- <img src="/images/mActionZoomActual.png" /> <i>Zoom to 100%</i>
- <img src="/images/mActionDraw.png" /> <i>Refresh view</i> (if you find the view in an inconsistent state)
- <img src="/images/mActionPan.png" /> <i>Pan composer</i>
- <img src="/images/mActionZoomToSelected.png" /> <i>Zoom</i> (zoom to a specific region of the Composer)

You can change the zoom level also using the mouse wheel or the combo box in the status bar. If you need to switch to pan mode while working in the Composer area, you can hold the `Spacebar` or the the mouse wheel. With `Ctrl+Spacebar`, you can temporarily switch to zoom mode, and with `Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar`, to zoom out mode.

## Sample Session <a name="sample-session"></a>

The following steps describe a sample workflow how to create a composer layout:

1. On the left site, select the <img src="/images/mActionAddMap.png" /> <i>Add new map</i> toolbar button and draw a rectangle on the canvas holding down the left mouse button. Inside the drawn rectangle the map view to the canvas.
2. Select the <img src="/images/mActionScaleBar.png" /> <i>Add new scalebar</i> toolbar button and place the map item with the left mouse button on the Print Composer canvas. A scalebar will be added to the canvas.
3. Select the <img src="/images/mActionAddLegend.png" /> <i>Add new legend</i> toolbar button and draw a rectangle on the canvas holding down the left mouse button. Inside the drawn rectangle the legend will be drawn.
4. Select the <img src="/images/mActionSelect.png" /> <i>Select/Move item</i> icon to select the map on the canvas and move it a bit.
5. While the map item is still selected you can also change the size of the map item. Click while holding down the left mouse button, in a white little rectangle in one of the corners of the map item and drag it to a new location to change it’s size.
6. Click the *Item Properties* tab on the left lower panel and find the setting for the orientation. Change the value of the setting *Map orientation* to ‘15.00° ‘. You should see the orientation of the map item change.
7. Finally, you can save your print composition with the <img src="/images/mActionFileSave.png" /> <i>Save Project</i> button.

## Print Composer Options <a name="print-composer-options"></a>

From *Settings &rarr; Composer Options* you can set some options that will be used as default during your work.

- *Compositions defaults* let you specify the default font to use.
- With *Grid appearance*, you can set the grid style and its color. There are three types of grid: **Dots**, **Solid** lines and **Crosses**.
- *Grid and guide defaults* defines spacing, offset and tolerance of the grid.

## Composition tab — General composition setup <a name="composition-tab-general-composition-setup"></a>

In the *Composition* tab, you can define the global settings of your composition.

- You can choose one of the *Presets* for your paper sheet, or enter your custom *width* and *height*.
- Composition can now be divided into several pages. For instance, a first page can show a map canvas, and a second page can show the attribute table associated with a layer, while a third one shows an HTML frame linking to your organization website. Set the *Number of pages* to the desired value. You can choose the page *Orientation* and its *Exported resolution*. When checked, <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *print as raster* means all elements will be rasterized before printing or saving as PostScript or PDF.
- *Grid and guides* lets you customize grid settings like *spacings*, *offsets* and *tolerance* to your need. The tolerance is the maximum distance below which an item is snapped to smart guides.

Snap to grid and/or to smart guides can be enabled from the *View* menu. In this menu, you can also hide or show the grid and smart guides.

## Composer items common options <a name="composer-items-common-options"></a>

Composer items have a set of common properties you will find on the bottom of the *Item Properties* tab: Position and size, Rotation, Frame, Background, Item ID and Rendering.

![](/images/print_composer_common_properties.png)

- The *Position and size* dialog lets you define size and position of the frame that contains the item. You can also choose which *Reference point* will be set at the **X** and **Y** coordinates previously defined.
- The *Rotation* sets the rotation of the element (in degrees).
- The <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Frame* shows or hides the frame around the label. Use the *Frame color* and *Thickness* menus to adjust those properties.
- Use the *Background color* menu for setting a background color. With the dialog you can pick a color.
- *Rendering* mode can be selected in the option field.


KADAS allows advanced rendering for Composer items just like vector and raster layers.

![](/images/rendering_mode.png)

- *Transparency*: You can make the underlying item in the Composer visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your item to your needs. You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the menu beside the slider.

- <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Exclude item from exports*: You can decide to make an item not visible in all exports. After activating this checkbox, the item will not be included in PDF’s, prints etc..

- *Blending mode*: You can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you previously only may know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying items are mixed through the settings described below.

    > -   Normal: This is the standard blend mode, which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the pixel beneath it; the colors aren’t mixed.
    > -   Lighten: This selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged and harsh.
    > -   Screen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer (e.g., you can use a hillshade to texture another layer).
    > -   Dodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So, brighter top pixels cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top pixels aren’t too bright; otherwise the effect is too extreme.
    > -   Addition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with pixel values of the other. In case of values above 1 (as in the case of RGB), white is displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.
    > -   Darken: This creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the results tend to be jagged and harsh.
    > -   Multiply: Here, the numbers for each pixel of the top layer are multiplied with the numbers for the corresponding pixel of the bottom layer. The results are darker pictures.
    > -   Burn: Darker colors in the top layer cause the underlying layers to darken. Burn can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.
    > -   Overlay: This mode combines the multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture, light parts become lighter and dark parts become darker.
    > -   Soft light: This is very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This mode is supposed to emulate shining a soft light onto an image.
    > -   Hard light: Hard light is very similar to the overlay mode. It’s supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.
    > -   Difference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel, or the other way around, to always get a positive value. Blending with black produces no change, as the difference with all colors is zero.
    > -   Subtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer with pixel values of the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.

## The Map item <a name="the-map-item"></a>

Click on the <img src="/images/mActionAddMap.png" /> <i>Add new map</i> toolbar button in the Print Composer toolbar to add the KADAS map canvas. Now, drag a rectangle onto the Composer canvas with the left mouse button to add the map. To display the current map, you can choose between three different modes in the map *Item Properties* tab:

-   **Rectangle** is the default setting. It only displays an empty box with a message ‘Map will be printed here’.
-   **Cache** renders the map in the current screen resolution. If you zoom the Composer window in or out, the map is not rendered again but the image will be scaled.
-   **Render** means that if you zoom the Composer window in or out, the map will be rendered again, but for space reasons, only up to a maximum resolution.

**Cache** is the default preview mode for newly added Print Composer maps.

You can resize the map element by clicking on the <img src="/images/mActionSelect.png" /> <i>Select/Move item</i> button, selecting the element, and dragging one of the blue handles in the corner of the map. With the map selected, you can now adapt more properties in the map *Item Properties* tab.

To move layers within the map element, select the map element, click the <img src="/images/unlocked.png" /><i>Unlock All Items</i> icon will unlock all locked composer items.


### Main properties <a name="main-properties"></a>

The *Main properties* dialog of the map *Item Properties* tab provides the following functionalities:

-   The **Preview** area allows you to define the preview modes ‘Rectangle’, ‘Cache’ and ‘Render’, as described above. If you change the view on the KADAS map canvas by changing vector or raster properties, you can update the Print Composer view by selecting the map element in the Print Composer and clicking the **\[Update preview\]** button.
-   The field *Scale* <img src="/images/selectnumber.png" /> sets a manual scale.
-   The field *Map rotation* <img src="/images/selectnumber.png" /> allows you to rotate the map element content clockwise in degrees. The rotation of the map view can be imitated here. Note that a correct coordinate frame can only be added with the default value 0 and that once you defined a *Map rotation* it currently cannot be changed.
-   <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Draw map canvas items* lets you show annotations that may be placed on the map canvas in the main KADAS window.
-   You can choose to lock the layers shown on a map item. Check <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Lock layers for map item*. After this is checked, any layer that would be displayed or hidden in the main KADAS window will not appear or be hidden in the map item of the Composer. But style and labels of a locked layer are still refreshed according to the main KADAS interface. You can prevent this by using *Lock layer styles for map item*.

![](/images/print_composer_map1.png)

### Extents <a name="extents"></a>

The *Extents* dialog of the map item tab provides the following functionalities:

![](/images/print_composer_map2.png)

-   The **Map extents** area allows you to specify the map extent using X and Y min/max values and by clicking the **\[Set to map canvas extent\]** button. This button sets the map extent of the composer map item to the extent of the current map view in the main KADAS application. The button **\[View extent in map canvas\]** does exactly the opposite, it updates the extent of the map view in the QGIS application to the extent of the composer map item.

If you change the view on the KADAS map canvas by changing vector or raster properties, you can update the Print Composer view by selecting the map element in the Print Composer and clicking the **\[Update preview\]** button in the map *Item Properties* tab.


### Grids <a name="grids"></a>

The *Grids* dialog of the map *Item Properties* tab provides the possibility to add several grids to a map item.

-   With the plus and minus button you can add or remove a selected grid.
-   With the up and down button you can move a grid in the list and set the drawing priority.

When you double click on the added grid you can give it another name.

![](/images/map_grids.png)

After you have added a grid, you can activate the checkbox to draw the grid.

![](/images/draw_grid.png)

As grid type, you can specify to use a ‘Solid’, ‘Cross’, ‘Markers’ or ‘Frame and annotations only’. ‘Frame and annotations only’ is especially useful when working with rotated maps or reprojected grids. In the devisions section of the Grid Frame Dialog mentioned below you then have a corresponding setting. Symbology of the grid can be chosen. Furthermore, you can define an interval in the X and Y directions, an X and Y offset, and the width used for the cross or line grid type.

![](/images/grid_frame.png)

- There are different options to style the frame that holds the map. Following options are available: No Frame, Zebra, Interior ticks, Exterior ticks, Interior and Exterior ticks and Lineborder.
- With ‘LatitudeY/ only’ and ‘Longitude/X only’ setting in the devisions section you have the possibility to prevent a mix of latitude/y and longitude/x coordinates showing on a side when working with rotated maps or reprojected grids.
- Advanced rendering mode is also available for grids.
- The <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Draw coordinates* checkbox allows you to add coordinates to the map frame. You can choose the annotation numeric format, the options range from decimal to degrees, minute and seconds, with or without suffix, and aligned or not. You can choose which annotation to show. The options are: show all, latitude only, longitude only, or disable(none). This is useful when the map is rotated. The annotation can be drawn inside or outside the map frame. The annotation direction can be defined as horizontal, vertical ascending or vertical descending. In case of map rotation you can Finally, you can define the annotation font, the annotation font color, the annotation distance from the map frame and the precision of the drawn coordinates.

![](/images/grid_draw_coordinates.png)

### Overviews <a name="overviews"></a>

The *Overviews* dialog of the map *Item Properties* tab provides the following functionalities:

![](/images/print_composer_map4.png)

You can choose to create an overview map, which shows the extents of the other map(s) that are available in the composer. First you need to create the map(s) you want to include in the overview map. Next you create the map you want to use as the overview map, just like a normal map.

- With the plus and minus button you can add or remove an overview.
- With the up and down button you can move an overview in the list and set the drawing priority.

Open *Overviews* and press the green plus icon-button to add an overview. Initially this overview is named ‘Overview 1’. You can change the name when you double-click on the overview item in the list named ‘Overview 1’ and change it to another name.

When you select the overview item in the list you can customize it.

- The <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Draw “&lt;name\_overview&gt;” overview* needs to be activated to draw the extent of selected map frame.
- The *Map frame* combo list can be used to select the map item whose extents will be drawn on the present map item.
- The *Frame Style* allows you to change the style of the overview frame.
- The *Blending mode* allows you to set different transparency blend modes.
- The <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Invert overview* creates a mask around the extents when activated: the referenced map extents are shown clearly, whereas everything else is blended with the frame color.
- The <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Center on overview* puts the extent of the overview frame in the center of the overview map. You can only activate one overview item to center, when you have added several overviews.

## The Label item <a name="the-label-item"></a>

To add a label, click the <img src="/images/mActionLabel.png" /> <i>Add label</i> icon, place the element with the left mouse button on the Print Composer canvas and position and customize its appearance in the label *Item Properties* tab.

The *Item Properties* tab of a label item provides the following functionality for the label item:

![](/images/print_composer_label1.png)

### Main properties <a name="id1"></a>

- The main properties dialog is where the text (HTML or not) or the expression needed to fill the label is added to the Composer canvas.
- Labels can be interpreted as HTML code: check <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Render as HTML*. You can now insert a URL, a clickable image that links to a web page or something more complex.
- You can also insert an expression. Click on **\[Insert an expression\]** to open a new dialog. Build an expression by clicking the functions available in the left side of the panel. Two special categories can be useful, particularly associated with the atlas functionality: geometry functions and records functions. At the bottom, a preview of the expression is shown.

### Appearance <a name="appearance"></a>

- Define *Font* by clicking on the **\[Font...\]** button or a *Font color* selecting a color using the color selection tool.
- You can specify different horizontal and vertical margins in mm. This is the margin from the edge of the composer item. The label can be positioned outside the bounds of the label e.g. to align label items with other items. In this case you have to use negative values for the margin.
- Using the *Alignment* is another way to position your label. Note that when e.g. using the *Horizontal alignment* in ![radiobuttonon](/images/radiobuttonon.png)*Center* Position the *Horizontal margin* feature is disabled.


## The Image item <a name="the-image-item"></a>

To add an image, click the <img src="/images/mActionAddImage.png" /> <i>Add image</i> icon, place the element with the left mouse button on the Print Composer canvas and position and customize its appearance in the image *Item Properties* tab.

The picture *Item Properties* tab provides the following functionalities:

![](/images/print_composer_image1.png)

You first have to select the image you want to display. There are several ways to set the *image source* in the **Main properties** area.

1.  Use the browse button <img src="/images/browsebutton.png" /> of *image source* to select a file on your computer using the browse dialog. The browser will start in the SVG-libraries provided with KADAS. Besides `SVG`, you can also select other image formats like `.png` or `.jpg`.
2.  You can enter the source directly in the *image source* text field. You can even provide a remote URL-address to an image.
3.  From the **Search directories** area you can also select an image from *loading previews ...* to set the image source.
4.  Use the data defined button <img src="/images/mIconDataDefine.png" /> to set the image source from a record or using a regular expression.

With the *Resize mode* option, you can set how the image is displayed when the frame is changed, or choose to resize the frame of the image item so it matches the original size of the image.

You can select one of the following modes:

- Zoom: Enlarges the image to the frame while maintaining aspect ratio of picture.
- Stretch: Stretches image to fit inside the frame, ignores aspect ratio.
- Clip: Use this mode for raster images only, it sets the size of the image to original image size without scaling and the frame is used to clip the image, so only the part of the image inside the frame is visible.
- Zoom and resize frame: Enlarges image to fit frame, then resizes frame to fit resultant image.
- Resize frame to image size: Sets size of frame to match original size of image without scaling.

Selected resize mode can disable the item options ‘Placement’ and ‘Image rotation’. The *Image rotation* is active for the resize mode ‘Zoom’ and ‘Clip’.

With *Placement* you can select the position of the image inside it’s frame. The **Search directories** area allows you to add and remove directories with images in SVG format to the picture database. A preview of the pictures found in the selected directories is shown in a pane and can be used to select and set the image source.

Images can be rotated with the *Image rotation* field. Activating the <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Sync with map* checkbox synchronizes the rotation of a picture in the KADAS map canvas (i.e., a rotated north arrow) with the appropriate Print Composer image.

It is also possible to select a north arrow directly. If you first select a north arrow image from **Search directories** and then use the browse button.

Note

Many of the north arrows do not have an ‘N’ added in the north arrow, this is done on purpose for languages that do not use an ‘N’ for North, so they can use another letter.

![](/images/north_arrows.png)


## The Legend item <a name="the-legend-item"></a>

To add a map legend, click the <img src="/images/mActionAddLegend.png" /> <i>Add new legend</i> icon, place the element with the left mouse button on the Print Composer canvas and position and customize the appearance in the legend *Item Properties* tab.

The *Item properties* of a legend item tab provides the following functionalities:

### Use smart page breaks and User style sheet <a name="use-smart-page-breaks-and-user-style-sheet"></a>

The *Use smart page breaks* dialog and *User style sheet* dialog of the HTML frame *Item Properties* tab provides the following functionalities:

![](/images/print_composer_html4.png)

-   Activate <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Use smart page breaks* to prevent the html frame contents from breaking mid-way a line of text so it continues nice and smooth in the next frame.

-   Set the *Maximum distance* allowed when calculating where to place page breaks in the html. This distance is the maximum amount of empty space allowed at the bottom of a frame after calculating the optimum break location.

# Manage items <a name="manage-items"></a>

## Size and position <a name="size-and-position"></a>

Each item inside the Composer can be moved/resized to create a perfect layout. For both operations the first step is to activate the <img src="/images/mActionSelect.png" /> <i>Select/Move item</i> tool and to click on the item; you can then move it using the mouse while holding the left button. If you need to constrain the movements to the horizontal or the vertical axis, just hold the `Shift` while moving the mouse. If you need a better precision, you can move a selected item using the `Arrow keys` on the keyboard; if the movement is too slow, you can speed up it by holding `Shift`.

A selected item will show squares on its boundaries; moving one of them with the mouse, will resize the item in the corresponding direction. While resizing, holding `Shift` will maintain the aspect ratio. Holding `Alt` will resize from the item center.

The correct position for an item can be obtained using snapping to grid or smart guides. Guides are set by clicking and dragging in the rulers. Guides are moved by clicking in the ruler, level with the guide and dragging to a new place. To delete a guide move it off the canvas. If you need to disable the snap on the fly just hold `Ctrl` while moving the mouse.

You can choose multiple items with the <img src="/images/mActionSelect.png" /> <i>Select/Move item</i> button. Just hold the `Shift` button and click on all the items you need. You can then resize/move this group just like a single item.

Once you have found the correct position for an item, you can lock it by using the items on the toolbar or ticking the box next to the item in the *Items* tab. Locked items are **not** selectable on the canvas.

Locked items can be unlocked by selecting the item in the *Items* tab and unchecking the tickbox or you can use the icons on the toolbar.

To unselect an item, just click on it holding the `Shift` button.

Inside the *Edit* menu, you can find actions to select all the items, to clear all selections or to invert the current selection.

## Alignment <a name="alignment"></a>

![](/images/alignment_lines.png)

To use an alignment functionality, you first select some elements and then click on the matching alignment icon. All selected elements will then be aligned within to their common bounding box. When moving items on the Composer canvas, alignment helper lines appear when borders, centers or corners are aligned.


## Copy/Cut and Paste items <a name="copy-cut-and-paste-items"></a>

The print composer includes actions to use the common Copy/Cut/Paste functionality for the items in the layout. As usual first you need to select the items using one of the options seen above; at this point the actions can be found in the *Edit* menu. When using the Paste action, the elements will be pasted according to the current mouse position.

Note

HTML items can not be copied in this way. As a workaround, use the **\[Add Frame\]** button in the *Item Properties* tab.

During the layout process, it is possible to revert and restore changes. This can be done with the revert and restore tools:

-   <img src="/images/mActionUndo.png" /> <i>Revert last change</i>
-   <img src="/images/mActionRedo.png" /> <i>Restore last change</i>

This can also be done by mouse click within the *Command history* tab.

![](/images/command_hist.png)


The Print Composer includes generation functions that allow you to create map books in an automated way. The concept is to use a coverage layer, which contains geometries and fields. For each geometry in the coverage layer, a new output will be generated where the content of some canvas maps will be moved to highlight the current geometry. Fields associated with this geometry can be used within text labels.

Every page will be generated with each feature. To enable the generation of an atlas and access generation parameters, refer to the Atlas generation tab. This tab contains the following widgets:

![](/images/print_composer_atlas.png)

-   <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Generate an atlas*, which enables or disables the atlas generation.
-   A *Coverage layer* <img src="/images/selectstring.png" /> combo box that allows you to choose the (vector) layer containing the geometries on which to iterate over.
-   An optional <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Hidden coverage layer* that, if checked, will hide the coverage layer (but not the other ones) during the generation.
-   An optional *Filter with* text area that allows you to specify an expression for filtering features from the coverage layer. If the expression is not empty, only features that evaluate to `True` will be selected. The button on the right allows you to display the expression builder.
-   An *Output filename expression* textbox that is used to generate a filename for each geometry if needed. It is based on expressions. This field is meaningful only for rendering to multiple files.
-   A <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Single file export when possible* that allows you to force the generation of a single file if this is possible with the chosen output format (PDF, for instance). If this field is checked, the value of the *Output filename expression* field is meaningless.
-   An optional <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Sort by* that, if checked, allows you to sort features of the coverage layer. The associated combo box allows you to choose which column will be used as the sorting key. Sort order (either ascending or descending) is set by a two-state button that displays an up or a down arrow.

You can use multiple map items with the atlas generation; each map will be rendered according to the coverage features. To enable atlas generation for a specific map item, you need to check <img src="/images/checkbox.png" />*Controlled by Atlas* under the item properties of the map item. Once checked, you can set:

-   A radiobutton ![radiobuttonon](/images/radiobuttonon.png) *Margin around feature* that allows you to select the amount of space added around each geometry within the allocated map. Its value is meaningful only when using the auto-scaling mode.
-   A ![radiobuttonoff](/images/radiobuttonoff.png) *Predefined scale* (best fit). It will use the best fitting option from the list of predefined scales in your project properties settings (see *Project &rarr; Project Properties &rarr; General &rarr; Project Scales* to configure these predefined scales).
-   A ![radiobuttonoff](/images/radiobuttonoff.png) *Fixed scale* that allows you to toggle between auto-scale and fixed-scale mode. In fixed-scale mode, the map will only be translated for each geometry to be centered. In auto-scale mode, the map’s extents are computed in such a way that each geometry will appear in its entirety.

## Labels <a name="labels"></a>

In order to adapt labels to the feature the atlas plugin iterates over, you can include expressions. For example, for a city layer with fields `CITY_NAME` and `ZIPCODE`, you could insert this:

    The area of [% upper(CITY_NAME) || ',' || ZIPCODE || ' is ' format_number($area/1000000,2) %] km2

The information \[% upper(CITY\_NAME) || ‘,’ || ZIPCODE || ‘ is ‘ format\_number($area/1000000,2) %\] is an expression used inside the label. That would result in the generated atlas as:

The area of PARIS,75001 is 1.94 km2


## Data Defined Override Buttons <a name="data-defined-override-buttons"></a>

There are several places where you can use a <img src="/images/mIconDataDefine.png" /> <i>Data Defined Override</i> button to override the selected setting. These options are particularly usefull with Atlas Generation.

With a Data Defined Override button you can dynamically set the paper orientation. For instance when the height (north-south) of the extents of a region is greater than it’s width (east-west), you rather want to use portrait instead of landscape orientation to optimize the use of paper.

In the *Composition* you can set the field *Orientation* and select Landscape or Portrait. We want to set the orientation dynamically using an expression depending on the region geometry. press the <img src="/images/mIconDataDefine.png" /> button of field *Orientation*, select *Edit ...* so the *Expression string builder* dialog opens. Give following expression:

    CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 'Landscape' ELSE 'Portrait' END

Now the paper orients itself automatically for each Region you need to reposition the location of the composer item as well. For the map item you can use the <img src="/images/mIconDataDefine.png" /> button of field *Width* to set it dynamically using following expression:

    (CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) - 20

Use the <img src="/images/mIconDataDefine.png" /> button of field *Heigth* to provide following expression:

    (CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 210 ELSE 297 END) - 20

When you want to give a title above map in the center of the page, insert a label item above the map. First use the item properties of the label item to set the horizontal alignment to ![radiobuttonon](/images/radiobuttonon.png) *Center*. Next activate from *Reference point* the upper middle checkbox. You can provide following expression for field *X* :

    (CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) / 2

For all other composer items you can set the position in a similar way so they are correctly positioned when page is automatically rotated in portrait or landscape.

This is just one example of how you can use Data Defined Overrides.

## Preview <a name="preview"></a>

Once the atlas settings have been configured and map items selected, you can create a preview of all the pages by clicking on *Atlas &rarr; Preview Atlas* and using the arrows, in the same menu, to navigate through all the features.

## Generation <a name="generation"></a>

The atlas generation can be done in different ways. For example, with *Atlas &rarr; Print Atlas*, you can directly print it. You can also create a PDF using *Atlas &rarr; Export Atlas as PDF*: The user will be asked for a directory for saving all the generated PDF files (except if the <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Single file export when possible* has been selected). If you need to print just a page of the atlas, simply start the preview function, select the page you need and click on *Composer &rarr; Print* (or create a PDF).

To maximise the space available to interact with a composition you can use *View &rarr;* <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Hide panels* or press `F10`.

*Note*: It's also possible to switch to a full screen mode to have more space to interact by pressing `F11` or using *View &rarr; Toggle full screen*.

Before printing a layout you have the possibility to view your composition without bounding boxes. This can be enabled by deactivating *View &rarr;* <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *Show bounding boxes* or pressing the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

The Print Composer allows you to create several output formats, and it is possible to define the resolution (print quality) and paper size:

-   The <img src="/images/mActionFilePrint.png" /> <i>Print</i> icon allows you to print the layout to a connected printer or a PostScript file, depending on installed printer drivers.
-   The <img src="/images/mActionSaveMapAsImage.png" /> <i>Export as image</i> icon exports the Composer canvas in several image formats, such as PNG, BPM, TIF, JPG,...
-   <img src="/images/mActionSaveAsPDF.png" /> <i>Export as PDF</i> saves the defined Print Composer canvas directly as a PDF.
-   The <img src="/images/mActionSaveAsSVG.png" /> <i>Export as SVG</i> icon saves the Print Composer canvas as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic).

If you need to export your layout as a **georeferenced image** (i.e., to load back inside KADAS), you need to enable this feature under the Composition tab. Check <img src="/images/checkbox.png" /> *World file on* and choose the map item to use. With this option, the ‘Export as image’ action will also create a world file.
