# Navigation

The Navigation Tab groups functionalities for interacting with a connected GPS device, as well as tools for drawing, importing and exporting GPX (GPS Exchange Format) waypoints and routes.


## <a name="sec0"></a>Enabling Geolocation

To use a GPS device with KADAS on Windows, the GpsGate Splitter application must be installed on the system, see [Configuring GPSGate](gpsgate/gpsgate.md).

The status of the GPS connection is displayed in the status bar in the lower area of the application window. This button can be toggled to set up resp. terminate a connection. The fill color of the status button changes depending on the current connection status

+ **Black**: GPS disabled
+ **Blue**: connection is being initialized
+ **White**: connection initialized, but no data is being received
+ **Red**: connection initialized, but no position data is available
+ **Yellow**: connection initialized, only 2D fix
+ **Green**: connection initialized, 3D fix

As soon as KADAS starts receiving position data from the GPS device, a marker will be placed on the map showing the current GPS position.


## <a name="sec1"></a>Moving with Geolocation

This functions enables automatic centering of the visible map extent at the current GPS position.


## <a name="sec2"></a>Drawing waypoints and routes

These functions allow drawing waypoints and routes, which can later be exported as GPS, for instance to upload to a GPS device.

**_Waypoints_** are simple points on the map, fitted with an optional name.

**_Routes_** are polylines, fitted with an option name and number.

Waypoints and routes are managed in a dedicated GPS Routes layer in the layer tree, analogous to redlining layers.

## <a name="sec3"></a>GPX export und import

These functions allow the user to export drawn waypoints and routed to a GPX file, as well as importing an existing GPX file into the **_GPS Routes_** layer.
